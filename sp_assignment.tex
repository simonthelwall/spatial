Although the distribution of the prevalence of stunting is approximately normal (Figure \ref{dist}), the distribution of the prevalence of underweightness is right skewed. 
As a result, the data is log transformed. 
There is no evidence to suggest that there is any correlation between the prevalence of stunting and the prevalence of underweightness, suggesting that those schools with a high prevalence of stunting are not the same as those with a high prevalence of underweightness. 
\begin{figure}[b]

\caption{Distribution of the prevalence of stunting and underweightness in school children attending school in Coastal Kenya.}
\label{dist}
\end{figure}

The spatial distribution of stunting and underweightness is shown in Figure \ref{dist_maps}. 
Visual inspection of the distribution suggests that there is a greater prevalence of stunting in the south west of the study region than in north east. 
In contrast, the spatial distribution of the prevalence of underweightness appears more even with no particular trend identifiable by visual inspection.

B) Locations of surveyed schools within the survey area. C) Distribution of the prevalence of stunting at surveyed schools. C)Distribution of the prevalence of underweightness at surveyed schools.}

\subsection*{B}
To investigate the spatial structure of the prevalence of stunting and underweightness, semivariograms were plotted. 
Because of the skewed nature of the distribution of underweightness in South East Kenya, the data was log transformed. 
Figure \ref{semi} shows the empirical and fitted semivariograms for stunting and underweightness. 
Semivariograms were fitted using the \texttt{variogram} and \texttt{fit.variogram} functions of the gstat package. 
The semivargiariogram for stunting suggests that spatial relationships account for some of the variance in the prevalence of stunting. 
The spatial effect is greater for stunting than it is for underweightness, as evidenced by the greater range of the semivariogram. 
For stunting, there is a spatial effect for up to 50 decimal degrees. 
For underweightness, spatial relationships have no effect beyond approximately 25 decimal degrees.

%G\textsuperscript{*}i
The second method chosen to investigate the spatial structure of the data was the Getis-Ord  \textit{G} statistic. 
This statistic examines the degree of spatial autocorrelation present in data. 
Weights were calculated using the \textit{k}-nearest neighbours method.
Once nearest neighbours had been determined, the Getis-Ord \textit{G} statistic was used to test for autocorrelation. 
This analysis used the spdep package to obtain the Getis-Ord \textit{G} statistic and the RANN package to identify \textit{k}-nearest neighbours. 
For the analysis, \textit{k} was set to three to allow detection of close spatial relationships and a one-sided test was performed.


The global \textit{G} statistic for stunting was 0.011 (p \textless 0.001).
For underweightness, the global \textit{G} statistic was 0.011 (p \textless 0.001).
The null hypothesis of the global \textit{G} test is that there is no spatial dependence in the distribution of a measure across the whole area and assumes that the \textit{G} statistic is normally distributed. 
The global \textit{G} test provides strong evidence that the null hypothesis should be rejected and that there is greater spatial dependence in the disrtibution of both stunting and underweightness in children across the study area that is expected by chance. 



To test for local autocorrelation it is possible to use the local \textit{G} test. 
The local \textit{G} identified 7 schools with higher levels of stunting than would be expected by chance alone (local \textit{G} p \textless 0.05) and 6. 
For underweight, there were 5 schools with higher levels of underweightness and 0 with lower levels of underweightness.
