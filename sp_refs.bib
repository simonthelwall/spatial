abstract = {Understanding the impact of place on health is a key element of epidemiologic investigation, and numerous tools are being employed for analysis of spatial health-related data. This review documents the huge growth in spatial epidemiology, summarizes the tools that have been employed, and provides in-depth discussion of several methods. Relevant research articles for 2000–2010 from seven epidemiology journals were included if the study utilized a spatial analysis method in primary analysis ( n = 207). Results summarized frequency of spatial methods and substantive focus; graphs explored trends over time. The most common spatial methods were distance calculations, spatial aggregation, clustering, spatial smoothing and interpolation, and spatial regression. Proximity measures were predominant and were applied primarily to air quality and climate science and resource access studies. The review concludes by noting emerging areas that are likely to be important to future spatial analysis in public health.},

abstract = {This paper reviews recent studies on the spatial epidemiology of human schistosomiasis in Africa. The integrated use of geographical information systems, remote sensing and geostatistics has provided new insights into the ecology and epidemiology of schistosomiasis at a variety of spatial scales. Because large-scale patterns of transmission are influenced by climatic conditions, an increasing number of studies have used remotely sensed environmental data to predict spatial distributions, most recently using Bayesian methods of inference. Such data-driven approaches allow for a more rational implementation of intervention strategies across the continent. It is suggested that improved incorporation of transmission dynamics into spatial models and assessment of uncertainties inherent in data and modelling approaches represent important future research directions.},

abstract = {Spatial epidemiology enables you to better understand diseases or ill-health processes; investigate relationships between the environment and the presence of disease; conduct disease cluster analyses; predict disease spread; evaluate control alternatives; and basically do things an epidemiologist otherwise would have been unable to do and avoid many errors that otherwise may have been committed. Recently, the discipline of spatial epidemiology has advanced substantially, owing to a combination of reasons. The introduction of the electronic computer has clearly led this advancement. Computers have facilitated the storage, management, display and analysis of data, which are critical to geographic information systems (GIS). Also, because of computers and their increased capabilities and capacities, data collection has greatly expanded and reached a new level owing in large part to the advent of geographic positioning systems (GPS). GPS enables the collection of spatial locations, which in turn present yet another attribute (location) amenable to consideration in epidemiologic studies. At the same time, spatial software has taken advantage of the evolution of computers and data, further enabling epidemiologists to perform spatial analyses that they may not have even conceived of 30 years before. Capitalizing on these now, non-binding technologic constraints, epidemiologists are more able to combine their analytic expertise with computational advances, to develop approaches, which enable them to make spatial epidemiologic methods an integral part of their toolkits. Instead of a novelty, spatial epidemiology is now more of a necessity for outbreak investigations, surveillance, hypothesis testing, and generating follow-up activities necessary to perform a complete and proper epidemiologic analysis.},

abstract = {Methods for the statistical analysis of stationary spatial point process data are now well established, methods for nonstationary processes less so. One of many sources of nonstationary point process data is a case-control study in environmental epidemiology. In that context, the data consist of a realization of each of two spatial point processes representing the locations, within a specified geographical region, of individual cases of a disease and of controls drawn at random from the population at risk. In this article, we extend work by Baddeley, M\o ller, and Waagepetersen (2000, Statistica Neerlandica54, 329-350) concerning estimation of the second-order properties of a nonstationary spatial point process. First, we show how case-control data can be used to overcome the problems encountered when using the same data to estimate both a spatially varying intensity and second-order properties. Second, we propose a semiparametric method for adjusting the estimate of intensity so as to take account of explanatory variables attached to the cases and controls. Our primary focus is estimation, but we also propose a new test for spatial clustering that we show to be competitive with existing tests. We describe an application to an ecological study in which juvenile and surviving adult trees assume the roles of controls and cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Successful HIV treatment as prevention requires individuals to be tested, aware of their status, linked to and retained in care, and virally suppressed. Spatial analysis may be useful for monitoring HIV care by identifying geographic areas with poor outcomes.

METHODS: Retrospective cohort of 1704 people newly diagnosed with HIV identified from Philadelphia's Enhanced HIV/AIDS Reporting System in 2008-2009, with follow-up to 2011. Outcomes of interest were not linked to care, not linked to care within 90 days, not retained in care, and not virally suppressed. Spatial patterns were analyzed using K-functions to identify "hot spots" for targeted intervention. Geographic components were included in regression analyses along with demographic factors to determine their impact on each outcome.

RESULTS: Overall, 1404 persons (82\%) linked to care; 75\% (1059/1404) linked within 90 days; 37\% (526/1059) were retained in care; and 72\% (379/526) achieved viral suppression. Fifty-nine census tracts were in hot spots, with no overlap between outcomes. Persons residing in geographic areas identified by the local K-function analyses were more likely to not link to care [adjusted odds ratio 1.76 (95\% confidence interval: 1.30 to 2.40)], not link to care within 90 days (1.49, 1.12-1.99), not be retained in care (1.84, 1.39-2.43), and not be virally suppressed (3.23, 1.87-5.59) than persons not residing in the identified areas.

CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to identify spatial patterns as a strong independent predictor of linkage to care, retention in care, and viral suppression. Spatial analyses are a valuable tool for characterizing the HIV epidemic and treatment cascade.},

abstract = {Spatial cluster analysis is a uniquely interdisciplinary endeavour, and so it is important to communicate and disseminate ideas, innovations, best practices and challenges across practitioners, applied epidemiology researchers and spatial statisticians. In this research we conducted a scoping review to systematically search peer-reviewed journal databases for research that has employed spatial cluster analysis methods on individual-level, address location, or x and y coordinate derived data. To illustrate the thematic issues raised by our results, methods were tested using a dataset where known clusters existed. Point pattern methods, spatial clustering and cluster detection tests, and a locally weighted spatial regression model were most commonly used for individual-level, address location data (n = 29). The spatial scan statistic was the most popular method for address location data (n = 19). Six themes were identified relating to the application of spatial cluster analysis methods and subsequent analyses, which we recommend researchers to consider; exploratory analysis, visualization, spatial resolution, aetiology, scale and spatial weights. It is our intention that researchers seeking direction for using spatial cluster analysis methods, consider the caveats and strengths of each approach, but also explore the numerous other methods available for this type of analysis. Applied spatial epidemiology researchers and practitioners should give special consideration to applying multiple tests to a dataset. Future research should focus on developing frameworks for selecting appropriate methods and the corresponding spatial weighting schemes.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Studies have typically investigated health and educational consequences of malaria among school-aged children in areas of high malaria transmission, but few have investigated these issues in moderate transmission settings. This study investigates the patterns of and risks for Plasmodium falciparum and anaemia and their association with cognitive and education outcomes on the Kenyan coast, an area of moderate malaria transmission.

METHODS: As part of a cluster randomised trial, a baseline cross-sectional survey assessed the prevalence of and risk factors for P. falciparum infection and anaemia and the associations between health status and measures of cognition and educational achievement. Results are presented for 2400 randomly selected children who were enrolled in the 51 intervention schools.

RESULTS: The overall prevalence of P. falciparum infection and anaemia was 13.0\% and 45.5\%, respectively. There was marked heterogeneity in the prevalence of P. falciparum infection by school. In multivariable analysis, being male, younger age, not sleeping under a mosquito net and household crowding were adjusted risk factors for P. falciparum infection, whilst P. falciparum infection, being male and indicators of poor nutritional intake were risk factors for anaemia. No association was observed between either P. falciparum or anaemia and performance on tests of sustained attention, cognition, literacy or numeracy.

CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in this moderate malaria transmission setting, P. falciparum is strongly associated with anaemia, but there is no clear association between health status and education. Intervention studies are underway to investigate whether removing the burden of chronic asymptomatic P. falciparum and related anaemia can improve education outcomes.},

The key advance on earlier methods is that the controls are not assumed to be a Poisson process.

@article{Mosha2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Within affected communities, Plasmodium falciparum infections may be skewed in distribution such that single or small clusters of households consistently harbour a disproportionate number of infected individuals throughout the year. Identifying these hotspots of malaria transmission would permit targeting of interventions and a more rapid reduction in malaria burden across the whole community. This study set out to compare different statistical methods of hotspot detection (SaTScan, kernel smoothing, weighted local prevalence) using different indicators (PCR positivity, AMA-1 and MSP-1 antibodies) for prediction of infection the following year.

METHODS: Two full surveys of four villages in Mwanza, Tanzania were completed over consecutive years, 2010-2011. In both surveys, infection was assessed using nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). In addition in 2010, serologic markers (AMA-1 and MSP-119 antibodies) of exposure were assessed. Baseline clustering of infection and serological markers were assessed using three geospatial methods: spatial scan statistics, kernel analysis and weighted local prevalence analysis. Methods were compared in their ability to predict infection in the second year of the study using random effects logistic regression models, and comparisons of the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for each model. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the effect of varying radius size for the kernel and weighted local prevalence methods and maximum population size for the spatial scan statistic.

RESULTS: Guided by AUC values, the kernel method and spatial scan statistics appeared to be more predictive of infection in the following year. Hotspots of PCR-detected infection and seropositivity to AMA-1 were predictive of subsequent infection. For the kernel method, a 1 km window was optimal. Similarly, allowing hotspots to contain up to 50\% of the population was a better predictor of infection in the second year using spatial scan statistics than smaller maximum population sizes.

CONCLUSIONS: Clusters of AMA-1 seroprevalence or parasite prevalence that are predictive of infection a year later can be identified using geospatial models. Kernel smoothing using a 1 km window and spatial scan statistics both provided accurate prediction of future infection.},

abstract = {Growing public awareness of environmental hazards has led to an increased demand for public health authorities to investigate geographical clustering of diseases. Although such cluster analysis is nearly always ineffective in identifying causes of disease, it often has to be used to address public concern about environmental hazards. Interpreting the resulting data is not straightforward, however, and this paper presents a guide for the non-specialist. The pitfalls include the fact that cluster analyses are usually done post hoc, and not as a result of a prior hypothesis. This is particularly true for investigations prompted by reported clusters, which have the inherent danger of overestimating the disease rate through "boundary shrinkage" of the population from which the cases are assumed to have arisen. In disease surveillance the problem of making multiple comparisons can be overcome by testing for clustering and autocorrelation. When rates of disease are illustrated in disease maps undue focus on areas where random fluctuation is greatest can be minimised by smoothing techniques. Despite the fact that cluster analyses rarely prove fruitful in identifying causation, they may-like single case reports-have the potential to generate new knowledge.},

The review is structured according to the three major branches of spatial statistics: continuous spatial variation; discrete spatial variation; and spatial point processes.},

abstract = {A review of some methods for analysis of space-time disease surveillance data is presented. Increasingly, surveillance systems are capturing spatial and temporal data on disease and health outcomes in a variety of public health contexts. A vast and growing suite of methods exists for detection of outbreaks and trends in surveillance data and the selection of appropriate methods in a given surveillance context is not always clear. While most reviews of methods focus on algorithm performance, in practice, a variety of factors determine what methods are appropriate for surveillance. In this review, we focus on the role of contextual factors such as scale, scope, surveillance objective, disease characteristics, and technical issues in relation to commonly used approaches to surveillance. Methods are classified as testing-based or model-based approaches. Reviewing methods in the context of factors other than algorithm performance highlights important aspects of implementing and selecting appropriate disease surveillance methods.},

abstract = {West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome and monkeypox are infectious diseases that have recently been introduced into areas far from their region of origin. The greatest risk of new diseases comes from zoonoses--pathogens that circulate among wild animals and are occasionally transferred to humans by intermediate invertebrate hosts or vectors that are sensitive to climatic conditions. Analytical tools that are based on geographical information systems and that can incorporate remotely sensed information about the environment offer the potential to define the limiting conditions for any disease in its native region for which there are at least some distribution data. The direction, intensity or likelihood of its spread to new regions could then be predicted, potentially allowing disease early-warning systems to be developed.},

abstract = {While undernutrition and infectious diseases are still persistent in developing countries, overweight, obesity, and associated comorbidities have become more prevalent. Uganda, a developing sub-Saharan African country, is currently experiencing the public health paradox of undernutrition and overnutrition. We utilized the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) to examine risk factors and hot spots for underweight, overweight, and obesity among adult females (N = 2,420) and their children (N = 1,099) using ordinary least squares and multinomial logit regression and the ArcGIS Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Overweight and obese women were significantly more likely to have overweight children, and overweight was correlated with being in the highest wealth class (OR = 2.94, 95\% CI = 1.99-4.35), and residing in an urban (OR = 1.76, 95\% CI = 1.34-2.29) but not a conflict prone (OR = 0.48, 95\% CI = 0.29-0.78) area. Underweight clustered significantly in the Northern and Northeastern regions, while overweight females and children clustered in the Southeast. We demonstrate that the DHS can be used to assess geographic clustering and burden of disease, thereby allowing for targeted programs and policies. Further, we pinpoint specific regions and population groups in Uganda for targeted preventive measures and treatment to reduce the burden of overweight and chronic diseases in Uganda.},

abstract = {Clusters of health events, such as chronic diseases, injuries, and birth defects, are often reported to health agencies. In many instances, the health agency will not be able to demonstrate an excess of the condition in question or establish an etiologic linkage to an exposure. Nevertheless, a systematic, integrated approach is needed for responding to reports of clusters. In addition to having epidemiologic and statistical expertise, health agencies should recognize the social dimensions of a cluster and should develop an approach for investigating clusters that best maintains critical community relationships and that does not excessively deplete resources. Health agencies should understand the potential legal ramifications of reported clusters, how risks are perceived by the community, and the influence of the media on that perception. Organizationally, each agency should have an internal management system to assure prompt attention to reports of clusters. Such a system requires the establishment of a locus of responsibility and control within the agency and of a process for involving concerned groups and citizens, such as an officially constituted advisory committee. Written operating procedures and dedicated resources may be of particular value. Although a systematic approach is vital, health agencies should be flexible in their method of analysis and tests of statistical significance. The recommended approach is a four-stage process: initial response, assessment, major feasibility study, and etiologic investigation. Each step provides opportunities for collecting data and making decisions. Although this approach may not always be followed sequentially, it provides a systematic plan with points at which the decision may be made to terminate or continue the investigation.},
